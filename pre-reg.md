## Note to Participants
* Participants are requested to bring their own laptops(along with a pair of earphones), with the following software tools installed.
1. Miniconda and a required environment - follow all the steps outlined here: <a href="https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/B/B_GetStarted.html#Downloading-the-FMP-Notebooks">https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/FMP/B/B_GetStarted.html#Downloading-the-FMP-Notebooks</a>. You will need to first download and extract the zipped file containing all the notebooks provided on that page.<br/>
(**Note**: To run the commands provided on the page, Windows users can open the command prompt from Start -> Anaconda -> Anaconda Prompt(Miniconda), and Linux/Mac users can work with a regular terminal)
2. Docker and a required container - follow the instructions outlined here - [Docker installation](docker_instr.md). This additional installation is required to enable the use of some other tools that are not available on conda.
