### About
Computational Musicology is an interdisciplinary area involving the application of computing methods to analyze music corpora and gain possibly new insights about the musical genre.  While sheet music has provided the basis for most Western music studies, Indian classical traditions can benefit from advances in digital audio processing.  Audio signal processing provides representations of music that can be compared and studied to obtain valuable insights about performance practice. This workshop will cover audio signal processing for melody and rhythm analyses and corpora design, and further, address the development of tools for musicological analyses of concert recordings. The final day will host a panel discussion with eminent musicians on identifying questions in Indian musicology that can benefit from empirical studies using the tools.
